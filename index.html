<h1>Drawing</h>
<h3>How It Started</h3>
<p>I started getting into art in the fifth grade when I was experiencing some things in my life. I really only started developing my own style and artistic interest in the seventh grade though.</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I draw lots, if not all of, my inspiration from animated shows. I want to go into animation (as a character designer and story writer) and so since the 8th grade I've been really looking into lots of media and stories.</p>
